# Welcome to my blog

Join me through my journey towards a better version of me, you and humanity. I'll share my experiences, thoughts and tutorials in the topics that interest me. I decided to start this blog because I truly believe in Prof.Richard Feynmann's quote:
> If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you do not understand it.
